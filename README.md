# Password-Locker
A Python application to store all of your passwords with encryption on your computer. 
It generates a key using a master password which the user inputs at the start of the program. The key generated using the master password is then used to unlock (decrypt) the encrypted passwords.


A GUI version of this is at https://github.com/Shiv-Patil/Password-Locker-GUI

# Important
Make sure there is a file named 'passwords.json' is the same directory as the key.py file.
